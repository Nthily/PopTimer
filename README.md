# PopTimer (developing)

PopTimer is a simple, lightweight Rubik's Cube timer, localization support, It uses the TNoodle library to generate scramble sequences for all current official speedsolving puzzles.

Special thanks to `Twisty Timer` for being my inspirations to create this project, especially the UI.

Thanks to the WCA's [TNoodle-lib](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle-lib), which provides the official tournament standard scramble
